# Pathfinder
Pathfinding algorithm with pygame and tkinter <br />
Follow the rules presented on in the tkinter scrollbox to avoid issues <br />
Can plot up to 5 points and a valid path will be found if possible <br />
Will use a heurisitc to of shortest distance from the current node to determine the visit order <br />
Hold left click to draw a barrier once the grid is open <br />
Then press either 'c' to clear, or 's' to solve.
